# React-Native-mobile-app
Developped a basic react native mobile app with a contact page, catalog page and an home page. 
I used a News API to get some news in the home page.
The app has an home page  and  a  footer   to navigate throught the different pages.
The catalog contain multiple porduct. 
I can access one specific product on CatalogDetail, ans send a message directly with the model 
number.
I developped this app using a Pluralsight course.
